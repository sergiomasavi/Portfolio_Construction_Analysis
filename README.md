Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning
url: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning

Description:
The Data Science and Machine Learning for Asset Management Specialization has been designed 
to deliver a broad and comprehensive introduction to modern methods in Investment Management, 
with a particular emphasis on the use of data science and machine learning techniques to improve 
investment decisions.By the end of this specialization, you will have acquired the tools required 
for making sound investment decisions, with an emphasis not only on the foundational theory and 
underlying concepts, but also on practical applications and implementation. Instead of merely 
explaining the science, we help you build on that foundation in a practical manner, with an 
emphasis on the hands-on implementation of those ideas in the Python programming language 
through a series of dedicated lab sessions.

Courses

- Course 1
    
    Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python
		    
    Description
    The practice of investment management has been transformed in recent years by 	
    computational methods. This course provides an introduction to the underlying 
    science, with the aim of giving you a thorough understanding of that scientific
    basis. However, instead of merely explaining the science, we help you build on 
    that foundation in a practical manner, with an emphasis on the hands-on 
    implementation of those ideas in the Python programming language. 
		
    This course is the first in a four course specialization in Data Science and
    Machine Learning in Asset Management but can be taken independently. In this
    course, we cover the basics of Investment Science, and we'll build practical
    implementations of each of the concepts along the way. We'll start with the
    very basics of risk and return and quickly progress to cover a range of topics 
    including several Nobel Prize winning concepts. We'll cover some of the most 
    popular practical techniques in modern, state of the art investment management 
    and portfolio construction.  
			
    As we cover the theory and math in lecture videos, we'll also implement the 
    concepts in Python, and you'll be able to code along with us so that you have 
    a deep and practical understanding of how those methods work. By the time you 
    are done, not only will you have a foundational understanding of modern 
    computational methods in investment management, you'll have practical mastery in 
    the implementation of those methods.     

	
- Course 2

    Advanced Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python	
    url: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning

    Description:
    The practice of investment management has been transformed in recent years by computational
    methods. Instead of merely explaining the science, we help you build on that foundation in
    a practical manner, with an emphasis on the hands-on implementation of those ideas in the 
    Python programming language. In this course, we cover the estimation, of risk and return 	
    parameters for meaningful portfolio decisions, and also introduce a variety of 
    state-of-the-art portfolio construction techniques that have proven popular in investment 
    management and portfolio construction due to their enhanced robustness.

    As we cover the theory and math in lecture videos, we'll also implement the concepts in 
    Python, and you'll be able to code along with us so that you have a deep and practical 
    understanding of how those methods work. By the time you are done, not only will you have 
    a foundational understanding of modern computational methods in investment management, 
    you'll have practical mastery in the implementation of those methods. If you follow along 
    and implement all the lab exercises, you will complete the course with a powerful toolkit 
    that you will be able to use to perform your own analysis and build your own implementations 
    and perhaps even use your newly acquired knowledge to improve on current methods.


- Course 3		
    
    Python and Machine Learning for Asset Management

    Description:
    This course will enable you mastering machine-learning approaches in the area of investment 
    management. It has been designed by two thought leaders in their field, Lionel Martellini 
    from EDHEC-Risk Institute and John Mulvey from Princeton University. Starting from the basics, 
    they will help you build practical skills to understand data science so you can make the best 
    portfolio decisions.

    The course will start with an introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, followed by 
    an in-depth discussion of the application of these techniques to portfolio management decisions, 
    including the design of more robust factor models, the construction of portfolios with improved 
    diversification benefits, and the implementation of more efficient risk management models. 

    We have designed a 3-step learning process: first, we will introduce a meaningful investment 
    problem and see how this problem can be addressed using statistical techniques. Then, we will see 
    how this new insight from Machine learning can complete and improve the relevance of the analysis.

    You will have the opportunity to capitalize on videos and recommended readings to level up your 
    financial expertise, and to use the quizzes and Jupiter notebooks to ensure grasp of concept.

    At the end of this course, you will master the various machine learning techniques in investment 
    management.


- Course 4

    Python and Machine-Learning for Asset Management with Alternative Data Sets

    Description:
    Over-utilization of market and accounting data over the last few decades has led to portfolio 
    crowding, mediocre performance and systemic risks, incentivizing financial institutions which are 
    looking for an edge to quickly adopt alternative data as a substitute to traditional data. This course 
    introduces the core concepts around alternative data, the most recent research in this area, as well 
    as practical portfolio examples and actual applications. The approach of this course is somewhat 
    unique because while the theory covered is still a main component, practical lab sessions and examples 
    of working with alternative datasets are also key. This course is fo you if you are aiming at carreers 
    prospects as a data scientist in financial markets, are looking to enhance your analytics skillsets to 
    the financial markets, or if you are interested in cutting-edge technology and research as  they apply 
    to big data. The required background is: Python programming, Investment theory , and Statistics. This 
    course will enable you to learn new data and research techniques applied to the financial markets while 
    strengthening data science and python skills.
